# Kubernetes
The repo Includes my learning modules for K8s
This repo is a learning journey for my  (K8s) certification. 
Install the minikube from the site:

 ## What is minikube?
 It is a miniaturised version of K8s that can help in running pods in the local machine without a cluster creation.

 In every Documentation generally , the things start with Pods, Deployments, Services . But I feel like its better we start the journey with Namespaces.
 ## What is a Namepsace?
- Namespace is a logical way of grouping resources that gets deployed in K8s. 
- For an Example, there is an organization under which there are multiple projects. Each project has its own applications that needs to be deployed.
- For each project we create a namespace and divide them logically where access and resource restrictions can be placed.
``` sh
 kubectl get namespace
 kubectl get ns
 ```
 ns is the shot form for namespace
 The below are the namespaces created when cluster is initialized.
- Default: Created automatically when the cluster is set up 
- Kube-system: Reserved for the Kubernetes control plane components and other system-related pods 
- Kube-public: Automatically generated and accessible by all users, including those who are not authenticated
- kube-node-lease: This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. Node leases allow the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control plane can detect node failure.


### Creating a Namespace

``` sh
kubectl create ns medical
```
The above command with create a namespace with the name medical. But I would advise to create resources in K8s using yaml files. This will help in setting up the Gitops. So, to create a sample yaml file without creating the resource, we can use the below command.
``` sh
kubectl create ns medical --dry-run=client -o yaml > medical/ns.yaml
```
Now to create the namespace from the yaml file run the below command,
``` sh
kubectl apply -f medical/ns.yaml
```
To check the resources that can be created under the namespace, we can use the following command.

``` sh 
kubectl api-resources namespaces=true
```

Each of the resource will be learned/discussed individually.

To know the description of the namespace we can use the below command

``` sh
kubectl describe ns medical
```

As discussed early, namespaces are are logical grouping of resources. And we can put the limit on the resource utilization by creating resource quotes and limit ranges.


## Resource Quota

```sh
kubectl create resourcequota medical --dry-run=client -o yaml > medical/rq.yaml
```

As shown in medical/rq.yaml file, one can define the quota for multiple resources inside the namespace like pod,service,storage,configmap and secrets.

Lets create a Pod to test the same.

## What is a Pod?
Pod is the smallest deployable unit in the Kubernetes. It is equivalent to a VM. 
Then what is container ?
In simple terms, Kubernetes has created a wrapper class above the container and called it as a Pod. We can't deploy containers directly in Kubernetes. We can only deploy Pods which in turn run the containers inside it. 

```sh
kubectl run  pod nginx  --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > medical/pod.yaml
kubectl apply -f medical/pod.yaml
```
When we have tried to create the pod, it resulted in the below error.

`Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "medical/pod.yaml": pods "pod" is forbidden: failed quota: full-quota: must specify limits.cpu for: pod; limits.memory for: pod; requests.cpu for: pod; requests.memory for: pod`

This is because, as we have applied the quota restrictions to the namespace, it is mandatory to add the same in Pod specification while deploying. Create the medical/pod2.yaml file and add the resource requests and limits. Or  Hint: Use the LimitRanger admission controller to force defaults for pods that make no compute resource requirements.

```sh
kubectl apply -f medical/pod2.yaml
```
- This will create the pod.
- Update the medical/rq.yaml file for pods value to 1 which means only one pod can be deployed under the namespace.
- Apply the changes.
- Create the new pod by changing the name in pod2.yaml. The following error will be thrown.
`Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "medical/pod2.yaml": pods "pod2" is forbidden: exceeded quota: full-quota, requested: pods=1, used: pods=1, limited: pods=1`

## Limit Range
Just like Resource Quote which helps in limiting the resource utilization on overall namespace level, limits (Limit Range) helps in restricting the utilization on individual object level (Pod).
How It Comes into Picture
1. Automatic Defaults
If a Pod or Container doesnâ€™t specify resource requests/limits, Kubernetes applies the default and defaultRequest values from the LimitRange.
2. Enforcing Constraints
If a Pod/Container specifies resources outside the defined range, the API server rejects the Pod.
For example:
If the LimitRange enforces a minimum CPU of 100m, but a Pod requests 50m, the Pod is rejected.
3. QoS Classification
A LimitRange can enforce minimum requests for CPU and memory, ensuring that Pods fall into Burstable or Guaranteed QoS classes instead of BestEffort.

Interaction Between LimitRange and ResourceQuota
LimitRange defines constraints for individual Pods/Containers.
ResourceQuota enforces limits at the namespace level.
When both are in place:
A Pod must satisfy the LimitRange constraints before it is allowed.
The total resources used by the Pod must not exceed the ResourceQuota.
For example:

LimitRange: Each Pod must request at least 100m CPU but no more than 2 CPU.
ResourceQuota: The namespace can use a total of 10 CPU.
A Pod requesting 3 CPU is rejected due to LimitRange.
If 8 Pods are already running and using 9 CPU, a Pod requesting 2 CPU is rejected due to ResourceQuota.

### QoS Classes Overview
BestEffort:

Pods in this class have no resource requests or limits set.
They are the lowest-priority workloads and are the first to be evicted under resource pressure.
Burstable:

Pods with partial resource specifications, where at least one container has a resource request or limit.
These have a higher priority than BestEffort Pods.
Guaranteed:

Pods where all containers specify equal resource requests and limits for both CPU and memory.
These are the highest-priority workloads and are the last to be evicted.

### ResourceQuota Scopes in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, ResourceQuota scopes help refine how resource quotas are applied to Pods and objects in a namespace. Scopes allow administrators to enforce quotas for specific types of workloads or objects by filtering based on their attributes, such as the QoS class or other characteristics.

Available ResourceQuota Scopes
Here are the scopes you can use when defining a ResourceQuota:

Terminating

Includes Pods that have an active spec.activeDeadlineSeconds field (i.e., Pods designed to terminate after a certain time, such as Jobs).
Use case: To restrict resources used by short-lived workloads like batch Jobs.
NotTerminating

Includes Pods without an active spec.activeDeadlineSeconds field (i.e., long-running workloads such as Deployments or StatefulSets).
Use case: To limit resources consumed by long-lived applications.
BestEffort

Includes Pods with no resource requests or limits specified for any container (i.e., Pods in the BestEffort QoS class).
Use case: To prevent or restrict resource usage by Pods without defined resource guarantees.
NotBestEffort

Includes Pods that are not in the BestEffort QoS class, such as Burstable or Guaranteed Pods.
Use case: To limit resources for workloads with partial or full resource specifications.
PriorityClass

Includes Pods with a specific PriorityClass.
Use case: To manage quotas for workloads based on their priority levels, ensuring critical workloads have reserved resources.
CrossNamespacePodAffinity

Includes Pods with cross-namespace pod affinity rules.
Use case: To restrict the resource usage of Pods with specific scheduling constraints that might affect multiple namespaces.
`Scopes for Storage (if storage quota is enabled):

BestEffort or NotBestEffort: Applies the storage quota only to objects like PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) associated with specific QoS levels.

Quota Based on QoS Class
```sh
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: burstable-quota
  namespace: demo
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "5"        # Maximum of 5 Pods
    requests.cpu: "5"  # Total requested CPU for all Pods
    requests.memory: "2Gi"
  scopeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - scopeName: NotBestEffort
```
